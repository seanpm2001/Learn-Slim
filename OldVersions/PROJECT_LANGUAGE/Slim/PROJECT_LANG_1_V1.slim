title: Project language file 1 - For: seanpm2001/Learn-Slim
desc: I decided to make Slim the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Slim) as Slim is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Slim programming language. It only makes sense to Slim the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
